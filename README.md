# Heart Disease Prediction Project  

Welcome to my **Heart Disease Prediction** project   
This project applies multiple **Machine Learning techniques** to predict whether a patient has heart disease based on medical data.

---

##  Project Objective  

The objective of this project is to analyze medical data, apply different machine learning models, and compare their performance to identify the **best model** for heart disease prediction.

---

##  Project Overview  

| Project | Description | Techniques & Tools |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Heart Disease Prediction | Predict heart disease using medical features | Classification, Clustering, Model Evaluation |

---

##  Tech Stack & Tools  

- **Python** – programming language  
- **Pandas & NumPy** – data preprocessing  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – data visualization  
- **scikit-learn** – machine learning algorithms  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – experimentation and analysis  
- **Pickle (.pkl)** – saving trained models  

---

##  Machine Learning Models Used  

###  Classification Models
- **Logistic Regression**  
- **Random Forest Classifier**  
- **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**  

###  Clustering Models
- **K-Means Clustering**  
- **Hierarchical Clustering**  

---

##  Best Performing Model  

After evaluating all models using **accuracy**, **confusion matrix**, and **classification report**,  
the **Random Forest Classifier** achieved the best overall performance and was selected as the final model.

Random Forest showed the best balance between **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score** compared to Logistic Regression and SVC.

---

##  Model Evaluation  

- Accuracy Score  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Classification Report  

These metrics were used to compare classification models and select the best-performing one.

---

##  Saved Model  

- The final trained model is saved as a `.pkl` file  
- The model can be loaded and used for predictions without retraining  
- Ready for deployment using **Streamlit** or **Flask**

---

##  How to Run the Project  

1. Open **Jupyter Notebook**  
2. Open the file:
3. Run all cells to see data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

##  What I Learned  

- Applying both **classification and clustering** techniques  
- Comparing multiple machine learning models  
- Evaluating models using standard performance metrics  
- Saving trained models for reuse and deployment  
- Working with real-world medical datasets  

---

## Future Improvements  

- Hyperparameter tuning for better performance  
- Feature selection and engineering  
- Deploy the model using **Streamlit**  
- Add a real-time prediction web interface
